       <h2><li>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</li></h2>
       <div style="background-color:red">
            <h3>The best way to explain  HTML is to think about car ,the car has defined shape,it has windows ,doors and position for everything.Now css is the internal decoration of car ,leather seats ,space between seats,color of carpet etc.While DOM is the visual representation of car which we can change virtually to see how it will look like .without changing real one. </h3>

          <h2><li> What is meant by boxifying design?</li></h2>
       <div style="background-color:gold">
            <h3>Boxifying design means represting design by dividing into boxes.The outer box can be the title and next box inside it has top as header and bottom as footer and internal box as heading,text etc.All this by side by side defining the magin of every box and space it will take.</h3>

       <div style="background-color:green">
            <h3>

                    The Box Model is basically a box that wraps around every single HTML element, and is made up of:
                    
                        <h2>content</h2>
                        <h2>padding</h2>
                        <h2>border</h2>
                        <h2>margin</h2>
                    
                    <p> All these can be given values to dictate how the box will look.</p>
