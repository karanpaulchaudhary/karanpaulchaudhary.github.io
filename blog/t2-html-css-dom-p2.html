                    Semantic structure according to me is the easy representaion of a webpage by using some attibutes at right place such as:
                    
                        <h2>Header</h2>
                        <h2>Article</h2>
                        <h2>Aside</h2>
                        <h2>Footer</h2>
                    
                    <p> All these make a sementic structure.</p>
